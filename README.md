This is my attempt to be reading and analyzing my vitals at a glance. I, personally, do not like to open Oura, Apple Health, etc applications on my phone all the time. Really annoying actually not to have a background sync or widget integration of some kind.

So since I do not have a particular Swift acumen, this project aims to read my vitals and display them on my website https://tim.solar

### Use as is. Or don't use at all.
### This is fun after all
